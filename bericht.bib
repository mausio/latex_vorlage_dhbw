	abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to study the relationship between rationality and decision making. As a specific objective it will be explained the benefit of learning in the decision making process derived from its results. The research question is: How does bounded rationality impact the decision making of organizations? The initial hypothesis is that the organization, as a social system, seeks to maintain the balance between the behavior that determines the positions of people and the structure of values and beliefs shared among them, but that is bounded to the rationality of the decision maker. The research method used is descriptive, being a qualitative analysis, that follows from the understanding of the behavioral theory of the firm also the behavioral decision theory, in terms of behavioral decision-making processes and the analysis through learning. The main conclusion is that bounded rationality occurs when companies lack context information of the results of their actions, being forced to make less than optimal decisions because they have to adjust to the conditions in which they operate. Decisions involve a commitment of large amounts of resources of the organization for the fulfillment of the objectives and purposes of the organization through the appropriate means. These means can be translated into models that help reduce the limits of rationality in organizations.},

	title = {Targeting Different Demographics},
	abstract = {The demographics of today’s users of technology must be considered when designing end-user applications and working in the field of {HCI}. Targeting one single demographic group when designing software results in dissatisfaction from users who may not fit within the demographic. The interaction styles, motivations for use and targeting of multiple demographics are presented as challenges through a survey of seven articles related to the field of {HCI} and demographics. All authors urge that extensive research be carried out to gain a better understanding of today’s technology users. Surveys, interviews and empirical studies are conducted to gather information about key demographics and associated behaviours and actions. The growing influence of the minority user demographics such as the older population and the lower-income class call for a shift in perspective when designing software for today’s end-user. Although some differences cannot be resolved and result in trade-offs of satisfaction between varying demographics, the importance of considering all different groups and their values and roles is emphasised.},

	abstract = {There are issues in traditional software development, e.g., the lack of user input and incomplete and changing requirements that can cause problems in projects. Both User-Centered Design ({UCD}) and agile software development are iterative approaches to software development, and they can increase the chances for delivering a successful project. {UCD} is a design process focusing on user research, user interface design and usability evaluation. Agile software development refers to a number of iterative andincremental software development methodologies that emphasize people, communication and the ability to adapt to change.

Integrating {UCD} and agile development would create a comprehensive systems development methodology. They do not have inherent obstacles that could prevent such integration, but both need to change before it can succeed. While no 'unified' Agile {UCD} methodology has been established, there has been a growing interest in learning how to integrate these two proven approaches over the last few years. In this thesis we explore the integration of {UCD} and agile development through experience reports andstudies that have been published in the industry and academia. We sketch a complete picture of the integrated development process and the related best practices. For example, design chunking and parallel track development are needed to fit {UCD} work into the fast paced life-cycle of agile development. In addition we provide some advice related to the organizational adoption of the process and its  practices.

	abstract = {Compliance reviews within a software organization are internal attempts to verify regulatory and security requirements during product development before its release. However, these reviews are not enough to adequately assess and address regulatory and security requirements throughout a software's development lifecycle. We believe requirements engineers can benefit from an improved understanding of how software practitioners treat and perceive compliance requirements. This paper describes an interview study seeking to understand how regulatory and security standard requirements are addressed, how burdensome they may be for businesses, and how our participants perceived them in the software development lifecycle. We interviewed 15 software practitioners from 13 organizations with different roles in the software development process and working in various industry domains, including big tech, healthcare, data analysis, finance, and small businesses. Our findings suggest that, for our participants, the software release process is the ultimate focus for regulatory and security compliance reviews. Also, most participants suggested that having a defined process for addressing compliance requirements was freeing rather than burdensome. Finally, participants generally saw compliance requirements as an investment for both employees and customers. These findings may be unintuitive, and we discuss seven lessons this work may hold for requirements engineering.},

To reflect a website's, service's, or app's privacy policies, they're frequently used as a beginning step for researchers investigating the reliability of stated data regulations, user comprehension of policy, or user control methods. It's challenging to collect information about privacy practices from Internet resources like websites and mobile applications for analysis because of the wide variations in the structure, presentation, and content. Most computer privacy studies attempt to test new methods for detecting, classifying, and analyzing computer privacy content. However, numerous papers have been published to promote research activities, and no trace of any bibliometric analysis work on computer privacy demonstrates research trends. By conducting a thorough analysis of computer privacy studies, it searches the Scopus database, which contains over 2000 papers published between 1976 and 2020. Using the bibliometric analysis technique, this study examines research activity in Europe, South America, and other continents. This work investigated the number of papers published, citations, research area, keywords, institutions, topics, and researchers in detail. An overview of the research efforts is followed by listing the words into a classification of computer privacy analysis tools, emphasizing the significance of a computer privacy research study. According to the investigation findings, there are numerous significant implications of research efforts in Europe compared to other continents. Finally, we summarize the review findings for each part by highlighting potential future research directions.},

	abstract = {Purpose Enterprise systems ({ES}) upgrade is fundamental to maintaining a system’s continuous improvement and stability. However, while the extant literature is replete with research on {ES} upgrade decision-making, there is scant knowledge about how different decision processes facilitate this decision to upgrade. This paper aims to investigate and better understand these processes from an organisational perspective. Design/methodology/approach The study adopted a qualitative survey design, and used a Web-based questionnaire and semi-structured interviews to collect data from 23 large organisations. Data accrued were qualitatively analysed and manually coded to identify the various decision processes undertaken during {ES} upgrade decisions. Findings Analysis results reveal complex interrelations between the upgrade drivers, the need to evaluate the new version’s functionality and the upgrade impact. Understanding the interaction between these elements influences the upgrade decision process. Research limitations/implications The study proposes {ES} upgrade processes that support a decision to upgrade major releases. Further research is required to offer either similar or conflicting arguments on the upgrade decision-making and provide a probabilistic generalisation of the decision-making processes. Originality/value The research offers a comprehensive and empirically supported methodical approach that embraces an evaluation of a new version’s functionality, technical requirements and concomitant upgrade implications as intrinsic decision processes. This approach assists in the decisions to establish the upgrade need and determine the level of change, effort required, impacts and associated benefits.},

	isbn = {978-0-691-13061-3},
	url = {https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1r2gkx},
	abstract = {This is the classic work upon which modern-day game theory is based. What began more than sixty years ago as a modest proposal that a mathematician and an economist write a short paper together blossomed, in 1944, when Princeton University Press published \textit{Theory of Games and Economic Behavior} . In it, John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern conceived a groundbreaking mathematical theory of economic and social organization, based on a theory of games of strategy. Not only would this revolutionize economics, but the entirely new field of scientific inquiry it yielded--game theory--has since been widely used to analyze a host of real-world phenomena from arms races to optimal policy choices of presidential candidates, from vaccination policy to major league baseball salary negotiations. And it is today established throughout both the social sciences and a wide range of other sciences.  This sixtieth anniversary edition includes not only the original text but also an introduction by Harold Kuhn, an afterword by Ariel Rubinstein, and reviews and articles on the book that appeared at the time of its original publication in the \textit{New York Times} , tthe \textit{American Economic Review} , and a variety of other publications. Together, these writings provide readers a matchless opportunity to more fully appreciate a work whose influence will yet resound for generations to come.},

In fact, while discussions of the measurability of utility before 1944 focused on the utility used to analyze decision-making between risk-free alternatives, after that year, discussions centered on the utility used to analyze decision-making between risky alternatives. In Theory of Games, the nature of the cardinal utility function u featured in von Neumann and Morgenstern’s {EUT}, and its relationship with the riskless utility function U of previous utility analysis remained ambiguous. Von Neumann and Morgenstern also put forward an axiomatic theory of measurement, which presents some similarities with Stanley Smith Stevens’s measurement theory but had no immediate impact on utility analysis.},

This means that Smith rejected the classical interpretation of probability  of La Place and the Bernoulli brothers, the limiting frequency-relative frequency interpretation of probability, and the personalist, subjectivist, psychological Bayesian approach used by all neoclassical schools of thought  because all of these approaches to probability claim that {ALL} probabilities can be represented by a single numeral between 0 and 1 and the decision maker knows the probability distributions. Smith, like Keynes, rejects this immediately.},
